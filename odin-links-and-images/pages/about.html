    noopener: The noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk.

For example:

<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Example</a>
In this code: target=”_blank”: opens the link in a new tab. rel=”noopener”: prevents the new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security. Without noopener, the new tab could use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe.
